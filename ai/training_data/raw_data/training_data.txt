We have various types of materials, including guest posts, slot reviews, casino reviews, blog articles, and other types of content for our project.



1) I’d like to clarify your rate per 100 words for writing, translation, and proofreading(reviews/guest posts/other material).



2) How many 1,000-word articles can you generally write per day?



3) Which tools do you use for plagiarism and AI checks?



4) Are you an agency? If so, which languages do you offer?



If you’re interested, I’d love to hear more about your experience and availability.
We have a defined workflow that we follow to ensure smooth collaboration and timely delivery:



1. Receive the brief from the content manager.



2. Write the text according to the brief and SEO requirements.



3. Submit the finished text for review to the content manager.



Deadlines normally given by content manager, but there are some basic rules:



Texts over 1000 words (reviews, listings, blog posts) — 2 business days.



Texts under 1000 words (game descriptions, news, guest posts) — 1 business day.



Revisions must be completed within 1 day to avoid missing deadlines.
